This plugin allows users to fly through a given path smoothly by placing waypoints in the world. When the player then uses "/path start" the plugin starts guiding/pushing the player in the way of the next waypoint. This is usefull for for example recording. A player can set out a path then start recording, and the server will do the moving while the player can enjoy the sightseeing.
